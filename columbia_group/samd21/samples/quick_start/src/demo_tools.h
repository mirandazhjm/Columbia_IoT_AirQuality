 *
 * The demo_tools contains everything that is not needed for sensor communication:
 * delay functions, port pins used for LED/button and the usart are initialized here.
 * There is a function provided to the main application which allows to
 * send a string (printf-style) over the serial connection to the terminal.
 * (you can read it using any terminal application, look for
 * The used COM port can be found within the device manager called
 * "EDBG Virtual COM Port".)
